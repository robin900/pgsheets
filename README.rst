pgsheets : Manipulate Google Sheets Using Python
================================================

pgsheets is a Python library for interacting with Google Sheets.
It makes use of `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ DataFrames,
2-dimensional structures perfectly
suited for data analysis and representing a spreadsheet.

This library can be integrated easily with your existing data to present dashboards, update documents, or provide quick data analysis.

The library has been tested in Python 3.4 and Python 2.7. Python 2/3 compatibility
is achieved using the `six` module from PyPI.

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Get / Set all or part of a Google Sheet
- Manage authorization with Google API
- Retrieve/set formulas or values
- Resize spreadsheets
- Add worksheets to and remove worksheets from a spreadsheet
- Open up a wealth of Pandas data tools to use on Google Sheets

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply install with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pgsheets

Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting up a Google Project
----------------------------

If you haven't already you will need to create a project in Google's Developer Console and get your Client ID and Client Secret.

#. Navigate to the `Google Developer Console <https://console.developers.google.com/project>`__
#. Create a project (you will be redirected to the project page)
#. Click on *APIs & Auth*
#. Click on *Consent screen* and set a Product Name
#. Now click on *credentials*.
#. Click *Create new Client ID* and select *Installed Application* > *Other*

Getting a Token
----------------------------

Using your Google *client id* and *client secret* we can get a
authorization URL to present to a user:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pgsheets import Token, Client
    >>> c = Client(my_client_id, my_client_secret)
    >>> c.getOauthUrl()
    'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?...'

By visiting this URL a Google user can consent to your application
viewing and modifying their Google sheets. After consenting to this
an access code is returned, which we use to get a token:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> my_token = c.getRefreshToken(access_code)
    >>> type(my_token)
    str
    >>> t = Token(c, my_token)

You need to save *my_token* for future use.

Editing a spreadsheet
-------------------------------------------

Create a spreadsheet (and make sure you save it) and copy the url.
Now we can access the Spreadsheet:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> from pgsheets import Spreadsheet
    >>> s = Spreadsheet(t, my_url)
    >>> s
    <Spreadsheet title='test' key='.....'>
    >>> s.getTitle()
    'test'
    >>> s.getWorksheets()
    [<Worksheet title='Sheet1' sheet_key='.....'>]
    >>> w = s.getWorksheet('Sheet1')
    >>> w.getTitle()
    'Sheet1'
    >>> w.setDataFrame(
            pd.DataFrame([['money', 'interest', 'years', 'result'],
                          ['1000', '0.015', '3', '=A2 * (1+B2) ^ C2']]),
            copy_columns=False,
            copy_index=False,
            resize=True)
    >>> w.asDataFrame()
              interest years                                  result
        money                                                       
        1000     0.015     3  =R[0]C[-3] * (1+R[0]C[-2]) ^ R[0]C[-1]
    >>> w.asDataFrame(values=True)
              interest years       result
        money                                                       
        1000     0.015     3  1045.678375
    >>> df = w.asDataFrame()
    >>> df['checked'] = "TRUE"
    >>> w.setDataFrame(df)
    >>> w.asDataFrame()
              interest years                                  result checked
        money                                                               
        1000     0.015     3  =R[0]C[-3] * (1+R[0]C[-2]) ^ R[0]C[-1]    TRUE

Adding or Removing Worksheets
--------------------------

Add a worksheet with `addWorksheet()`, and remove a Worksheet object
with `removeWorksheet()`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> from pgsheets import Spreadsheet
    >>> s = Spreadsheet(t, my_url)
    >>> s
    <Spreadsheet title='test' key='.....'>
    >>> s.getWorksheets()
    [<Worksheet title='Sheet1' sheet_key='.....'>]
    >>> w = s.addWorksheet('My Title')
    <Worksheet title='My Title' sheet_key='.....'>
    >>> w.getTitle()
    'My Title'
    >>> s.getWorksheets()
    [<Worksheet title='Sheet1' sheet_key='.....'>, <Worksheet title='My Title' sheet_key='.....'>]
    >>> s.removeWorksheet(w)
    >>> s.getWorksheets()
    [<Worksheet title='Sheet1' sheet_key='.....'>]

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the following cannot be done with pgsheets:

- Create a spreadsheet
- Rename a spreadsheet or a worksheet
- Prevent certain values from changing slightly e.g. 'True' becomes 'TRUE'

Finally the Google API has some limitations.
Ideally this code should not cause any changes to a worksheet:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> w.setDataFrame(w.asDataFrame())

Unfortunately, there are certain edge cases. 
For example, with a Formula such as the following

=======    =======
={1, 2}
=======    =======

which displays across two cells:

=======    =======
  1         2
=======    =======

There is no clear way to know
that the cell on the right wasn't input as a '2' by the user.
Thus the above code would cause the following output:

=======    =======
={1, 2}      2
=======    =======

which displays as:

=======    =======
 #REF!       2
=======    =======
